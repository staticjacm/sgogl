# sgogl
Simple Graphics - OpenGL
aka SGOGL

Just my shitty little graphics library I made partly for fun and partly for a simple graphics library for other projects. I used GLFW and SOIl to make it

The design was very greatly influenced and inspired by BearLibTerminal (http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal). A truly great graphics library that is a beacon of simplicity
This, however, isn't BLT, it's SGOGL. Good luck trying to use it. I understand it because I made it and I don't care if anyone else can or can't understand it.

Its kind of just like a proxy for GLFW to make it easy(er) to make a window and start rendering stuff

BLT: for inspiration

GLFW: because SGOGL uses it (and for the confidence I got from it to use a really shitty name)

SOIL: Simple Opengl Image Loading Library, or something like that. I also used it too. It's pretty cool
