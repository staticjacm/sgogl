This folder contains everything you need to compile and link (into a dynamic library) sgogl

Just run build_lib.bat (but look in it first to make sure I'm not accidentally deleting system32, or something) and that should produce a libsgogl.a and sgogl.dll

Put libsgogl.a into your lib folder (or wherever) and the dgogl.dll into the root of your project folder
