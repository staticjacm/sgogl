# sgogl
Simple Graphics - OpenGL
aka SGOGL

Just my shitty little graphics library I made partly for fun and partly for a simple graphics library for other projects. I used GLFW to make it

The design was very greatly influenced and inspired by BearLibTerminal (http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal). A truly great graphics library that is a beacon of simplicity
This, however, isn't BLT, it's SGOGL. Good luck trying to use it. I understand it because I made it and I don't care if anyone else can or can't understand it.

# Credits:

BLT: for inspiration

GLFW: because SGOGL uses it (and for the confidence I got from it to use a really shitty name)
