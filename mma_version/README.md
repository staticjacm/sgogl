# Mathematica/Wolfram Language Bindings

This should ;) work...

~~I haven't been able to test it because it requires x64 dlls so I have to recompile some dependencies which is a pain in the ass on wangblows~~

~~I will do that at some other time because I am busy with other things now~~

~~There might be a way to make it run with x32 dlls but I don't know how~~

~~If it does work, however, then you have a simple 2d rendering environment that you can easily render images, lines and point in Mathematica which is really cool~~

It **does** work and it appears to be great, have fun anyone who can make it work for themselves :D
